## Helmholtz Data Federation (HDF) / HIFIS
HIFIS / HDF do now support dynamic client registration, but there is a
preregistered public client so that account configuration generation is as easy
as with dynamic client registration.

### Quickstart
Example:
```
$ oidc-gen --pub <shortname>
[...]
Issuer [https://login.helmholtz.de/oauth2/]: 
Space delimited list of scopes [openid profile offline_access]: 
Generating account configuration ...
accepted
To continue and approve the registered client visit the following URL in a Browser of your choice:
https://[...]
[...]
success
The generated account config was successfully added to oidc-agent. You don't have to run oidc-add.

Enter encryption password for account configuration '<shortname>': 
Confirm encryption Password: 
```

### Advanced options

#### Manual Client registration
- Make sure you **donâ€™t** have an active login in unity and visit the /home endpoint (i.e. https://login.helmholtz.de/home )
- **Don't login**
- Click "Register a new account" on the top right
- Click "Oauth2/OIDC client Registration"
- Specify the required information, but note the following:
    - "User name" is your `client_id`
      - Needs to be globally unique, "`oidc-agent`" will clash. Use
          "`oidc-agent_<your name>`" instead. You Must Not include a colon.
    - "Password credential" is your `client_secret`
    - "Service Admin Contact": `Your email address`
    - "Service Security Contact": `Your email address`
    - "Service DPS URL": `https://github.com/indigo-dc/oidc-agent/blob/master/PRIVACY`
    - "Service Description": `https://github.com/indigo-dc/oidc-agent`
    - "OAuth client return URL (1)": `http://localhost:4242`
        - click "`+`" to add more URLs
    - "OAuth client return URL (2)": `http://localhost:8080`
    - "OAuth client return URL (3)": `http://localhost:43985`
    - "OAuth client return URL (4)": `edu.kit.data.oidc-agent:/redirect`

Note also that you have to enter at least one valid redirect uri, even if they
are not mandated by HDF (see [Client Configuration
Values](client-configuration-values.md#redirect-uri) for
more information).

After the client is registered, call oidc-gen with the `-m` flag and enter the
required information.
